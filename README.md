# GetEducated
This repo contains source code of the website where you can find interesting podcasts as well as free audio books. All of them are related to business, tech, economics, web3.0, law, marketing and sales and some others fascinating topics. You can think of this website as a collection of inspiration as I've put the best there, only the book and podcasts I listen to personally and those I can recomment to my friends. As soon as I finish this project, I will deploy it on the internet so anyone can visit it and get the same value I get from it. 
If you're like me and are interested in the topics I've described above then I'm sure you'll like it ;)

# The Idea Behind
When I walk or drive somewhere (meeting/gym/uni, doesn't really matter) I prefer listen to an interesting book, podcast or just to convert an article that I may found recently into audio format. That's exactly how I got the idea for this project.
